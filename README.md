# KatsConnect
This is the group project I worked on with my teammates in my Software Engineering course at SHSU. It's a website called KatsConnect (which was previously available at the domain "shsustudents.com") that was created with the intention of giving SHSU students easy access to certain utilities, such as buying and selling items like textbooks in the "Marketplace" (my portion), advertising and requesting tutoring services in "TutorKats", access to information relevant to SHSU students in "Campus Direct", and a forum for students to openly discuss school-related matters called the "Bulletin Board". There's also a user profile page where one could keep track of their posts on the Marketplace and TutorKats. Along with most of the rest of my group, this was my first serious attempt at building a website from scratch. PHP, HTML, and CSS were all utilized to build the site. Bootstrap was used to make improvements to the UI.
